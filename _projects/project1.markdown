I am a research intern in the COVID modeling team at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/){:target="\blank"} and a volunteer with the [COVID-19 Data Science Consortium](https://www.covid19datascienceconsortium.org/){:target="\blank"}. Our team performs medical demand forecasting and scenario modeling for highly impacted Indian regions. We have developed SEIR-like compartmental models for forecasting with Bayesian optimization to estimate the parameters ([source code](https://github.com/dsindiavscovid/covid19-india/tree/staging){:target="\blank"}). Our [work](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/10/27/2020.10.19.20215293){:target="\blank"} was accepted at ACM [CODS-COMAD 2021](https://cods-comad.in/index.html){:target="\blank"}. 

Along with researchers from [Data Science India vs COVID-19](https://dsindiavscovid.org/){:target="\blank"}, I have also worked on the problem of managing an epidemic by determining the optimal policy for transmission control. To this end, we proposed an analytical framework combining aspects of epidemiological models (SIR) and Lotka-Volterra (LV) systems ([pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/11/13/2020.11.10.20211995){:target="\blank"}) ([source code](https://github.com/dsindiavscovid/CoSIR)).

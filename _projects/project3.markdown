I have been a member of Project Jatayu, my college's autonomous UAV team, since 2017. I participated with my team in the 2019 annual [AUVSI SUAS](https://www.auvsi-suas.org/){:target="\blank"} competition at Webster Field, Maryland. We demonstrated our UAV in the 2019 annual AUVSI SUAS competition in Maryland and placed 27<sup>th</sup> among 75 teams, winning a cash prize. I was responsible for interoperability software and image transmission, and worked on software integration. I have also worked on object detection, localization and classification (ODLC) tasks.

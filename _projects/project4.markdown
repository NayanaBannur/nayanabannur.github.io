We developed a virtual reality supermarket to provide an immersive shopping experience for users. The application was implemented in C# using Unity3D. We implemented interactions in the user environment which allow a user to browse the supermakert, pick up and view virtual products, add them to a shopping cart and checkout. We also designed and incorporated a product recommendation system based on a collaborative filtering model. This project was funded by KSC Japan.

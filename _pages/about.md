I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University doing my master's in Machine Learning. I previously did my bachelor's in Computer Science at R.V. College of Engineering, Bangalore. I worked as a research intern at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/){:target="\blank"} from June 2020 to June 2021.
